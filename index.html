    <h4>Welcome!<br /> My name is Haley and this blog was created to review recipes I find online (mostly Tasty recipes off Facebook). Recently I have moved to Colorado and am living with my family who loves to cook, as opposed to my childhood home where takeout is the most popular option for dinner. It made me fascinated with the culture (and creation) of food and I wanted to find a way to get involved with cooking while also sharing my experience with others. I hope that you find it helpful in creating your own tasty recipes if you decide to in the future :) enjoy!</h4>
    <h4>Let's get started..</h4>
    <h4>The first recipe I attempted was the Salted S'mores Truffles.
